# Titanic-Prediction
 Model to predict which passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

This is based on the kaggle competition named "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". In this I have used Random Forest classifier to predict which passenger survives and which doesnt. Further i have used GridSearchCV to find optimum hyperparameters.
The accuracy of the model on the test set given by kaggle is 78.947%.
